# Object-Oriented-Programming-SVG-Logo-Maker
The project uses inquirer to ask a set of questions for what to create for svg file. When all the inputs are done there is a set of code using classes to create an object of the answers inputed to help create the shape a user wants. When user finishes putting there answers in terminal an svg of what they created will pop up. There is also a npm used called jest to help test if what a person types will break the code or not.
